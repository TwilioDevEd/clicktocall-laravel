      ## How It Works

      Let's go over the necessary steps to implement click-to-call:

      ![Click-to-call Diagram](//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/deved/clicktocall.png)


      1. A website visitor wants to connect to your organization.  She submits a web form with her
      phone number to receive a call connecting her to your sales or support team.

      1. Your web application receives the submission form.  An HTTP request is initiated from your
      application to Twilio to initiate an outbound call.

      1. Twilio receives the request and initiates a call to the user's phone number.

      1. User receives the call.

      1. After the call connects, Twilio asks our application for [TwiML
      instructions](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml). Our TwiML instructs Twilio to connect the user
      to our sales or support teams.

      ## What We Will Learn

      This How-To demonstrates how to initialize a call using the [Twilio REST
      API](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest) and how to create a TwiML call logic using the
      [Say](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/say) verb.

      Sounds like a plan? Let's get started!

      ## Environment

      To create our click-to-call application we need to setup our environment first.

      Let's put our Twilio credentials in a place where our application can access them. For the
      purposes of this tutorial, we'll place them as environment variables that our application can read.

      You can find your Twilio credentials in your [Account Dashboard](//www.twilio.com/user/account).

      For more instructions on how to run the application refer to the [app's
      readme file](//github.com/TwilioDevEd/clicktocall-laravel/blob/master/readme.md).

      ## The Web Form

      The first step on creating a real click-to-call solution is by building the form that your
      user needs to fill on the web. No need to overthink this, the real goal is to POST the User's name
      and phone number to your controller.

      So what information does this form need? An input for the phone number and
      a submit button. Since the page doesn't need to render new content after clicking
      on submit, we decided to implement the POST action via Ajax using jQuery.
      Let's take a look at it.

  .step(data-title='Submit the Form', data-file='public/app.js', data-highlight="11-30")
    :markdown
      ## Submit the Form

      To make the click to call feature more seamless we used
      [Ajax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX) to send the form asynchronously. This
      code shows one way you could implement this functionality using [jQuery](http://jquery.org).

      This code does the following:

      * Watches for the user "submitting" the form element
      * Submits the form data to our controller
      * Lets the user know if the submission was successful or not

      This is a common implementation of jQuery's `$.ajax()` method. Notice that we are
      returning the response message when the call has connected.

      Now that we have the front end done lets build the back end that will receive this data and
      call the user.

    data-highlight="23-46")
    :markdown
      ## Making a Phone Call

      Next we initiate a `Services_Twilio` object with our Account SID and Auth Token. This is essentially
      our PHP REST API handler, which we could use to send SMS or a myriad of other things. But for
      now we just need it to get access to create phone calls.

      We'll use the REST API to [make an outgoing phone call][voice] which
      requires us to pass a `From` number, a `To` number and the [`URL Parameter`][url]
      that tells Twilio what to do after it
      connects the call to our user. In this case Twilio needs to dial in the Agent once the call has
      been placed. We'll discuss this more later.

      Assuming we have successfully connected our user to our agent, we need to send a response to the
      browser telling it that all went well. This is the message that our ajax handler was expecting.

    :markdown
      ## Generating TwiML

      TwiML is a set of [simple verbs][verbs] written in XML that Twilio reads as instructions.
      In this case our instructions inform Twilio to simply SAY something to the user. If we wanted
      to connect the user to a real support agent, we would have to add a
      [Dial verb](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/dial) that specifies the support agent number
      so the customer can talk to him/her.

      In order to make writing TwiML easy, many of the helper libraries have methods that generate
      TwiML for you. In this case we use [twilio-php](//www.twilio.com/docs/php/install)
      to create a TwiML response that will instruct
      Twilio to say something.

      ## Where to next?

      That's it! We've just implemented click to call that allow your customers to connect with a
      support agent.
